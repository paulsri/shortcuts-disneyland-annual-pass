1. Take screenshots of your Disneyland annual passes
2. Place screenshots in an album (not shared) named "Magic Key"
3. Run shortcut

You can assign to your iPhone action button if you happen to have an iPhone and said iPhone has an action button for even easier access. For me, I use a shortcuts widget on my Today view
